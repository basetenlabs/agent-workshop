# Open Source Agents Workshop by Baseten

Welcome to the Open Source Agents Workshop by Baseten!

In this workshop, you'll build agentic workflows powered by `DeepSeek V3 0324`,
one of the most powerful and capable open source models on the market today.
See how easy it is to switch from closed to open models with OpenAI-compatible
Model APIs on Baseten.

## Step 1: Set up with Baseten

In this workshop, we use [Model APIs](https://www.baseten.co/products/model-apis/)
on Baseten for quick access to powerful open-source foundation models.

To get started:

1. Create a [Baseten account](https://app.baseten.co/signup/)
2. Add [DeepSeek V3](https://app.baseten.co/model-apis/create) to your workspace
3. Create an [API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/api_keys) and save it securely

When you create a new Baseten account, you'll automatically be issued enough credits
to complete this workshop + do plenty of experimentation. If you end up in a waiting
room after signing up, flag the workshop organizer to bypass the filter.

## Step 2: Build your first agent

Follow [Basten_Agent_Workshop.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gcpb37EmXIhDU3DPvyS7h3BU5K1hb3NA?usp=sharing) for step-by-step guidance to build your first agent.

## Step 3: Explore more models and agents

This workshop is just a taste of what you can build! Expand on the getting started
notebook with new models and use cases:

* Implement another [example agent](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/examples)
* Try another [model API](https://app.baseten.co/model-apis/create) like Llama 4
* Add another modality using models deployed from the [Baseten model library](https://www.baseten.co/library/)
* Explore Baseten further with the [documentation](https://docs.baseten.co/overview)
